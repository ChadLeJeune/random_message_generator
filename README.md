# Random Message Generator

## Introduction
This is a Codeacademy portfolio project. Everytime the program is run, a random message is output. The random messages all relate to swimming. 

The three components of the message are a swimmer's name, the event, and the time. There is also a conditional component that takes the event and time and outputs if the time broke the meet record for the given event.
